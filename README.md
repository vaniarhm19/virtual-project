# Virtual-Project
This project was from KPMG Data Analytics Virtual Project Internship

## Introduction
In this task, we get the raw dataset from KPMG which is from its client, Sprocket Central Pty Ltd. This company needs help to improve and optimize their bikes selling by giving us 3 datasets, Customer Demographic, Customer Addresses, and Transactions data in past 3 months, and New Customer List. They want us to recommend new customers should be targeted the most.

## Data Cleaning
First of all, we need to do the data cleaning. Raw dataset might contain any unnecessary data which has to be cleaned before we analyze. Such as the unnecessary column, missing values, unmatch format, and so on. Here, we did it on python and the codes can be seen [here](DataCleaning.ipynb) Clean dataset ready to be explored.

## Data Exploration
With the cleaning data, now we will exploring it. At this step we try to explore the data and find information between them and each other. After that, an analysis of the information is carried out. Apart from that, customer grouping was also carried out using RFM analysis. This is to make it easier to determine new target customers later. The code can be seen [here](DataExp.ipynb). And the presentation about the findings can be seen [here](Task 2.pptx).
