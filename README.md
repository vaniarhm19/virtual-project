# Virtual-Project
This project was from KPMG Data Analytics Virtual Project Internship

## Introduction
In this task, we get the raw dataset from KPMG which is from its client, Sprocket Central Pty Ltd. This company needs help to improve and optimize their bikes selling by giving us 3 datasets, Customer Demographic, Customer Addresses, and Transactions data in past 3 months, and New Customer List. They want us to recommend new customers should be targeted the most.

## Data Cleaning
First of all, we need to do the data cleaning. Raw dataset must contain any unnecessary data which has to be cleaned before we analyze. Such as the unnecessary column, missing values, unmatch format, and so on. Here, I do it on python and the codes can be seen here. ((kasih link)) Clean dataset ready to be explored.
